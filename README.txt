Welcome to the Port Lime Modding Republic! I'm Lime, and here's how this
all works.

I'm modding Sid Meier's Civilization VI (with Rise and Fall enabled!) so
I need a space to put all my mod work since I juggle like 378 and a half
different projects at a time. Enter github! Each of my projects, whether
it is is a full-on civilization, a leader, or even a daring feat such as
making a gameplay mod, will have its own branch that I will commit to.

This is pretty much to help me organize stuff and also to share files to
people who can help me out since my code sucks. Speaking of that, expect
to find all manner of horrible humor, desperate rant, and bizarre poetry
all over the code I'm gonna have written up. I will be very honest about
this, it's gonna be strange and you better learn to expect anything.

So, the reason this is a modding republic is for RP.

I'm a part of the Empire of JFD and JanBoruta, which is like the biggest
modding giant there is, but I also do basically my own thing - just like
a free city within an empire. I trade text, diplomacy, banter for stuffs
like sql, lua, help, and art! I'm a merchant and a pirate - hence PLMR.

Without further ado, here are the projects I'm currently working on:

1. Thule Fix with Rise and Fall in mind
2. Release of Yu
3. Javraganak
4. Khrushchev
5. Ottomans + Selim
6. Somalia + Sarjelle
7. Teotihuacan + Atlatl Cauac
